## Personal Development Planner Game

Personal development plans are a great tool for developing one's own skills and reflecting upon their progression towards some personal goal if that person is motivated enough to correctly engage with their plan. However, people often find PDPs boring, and naturally they wont refer to their plan as often as they should, or sometimes might forget about it entirely.

## Project aim

This project will examine whether presenting a PDP as a game is more likely to engage a player in their plan, and if so, how much more effective would it be in developing the playerâ€™s skills.
The focus of this project is to study personal development plans and serious games to understand how these two concepts can be combined to overcome the primary downfall of PDPs. This investigation was motivated by our first-hand experience of the downfalls of PDPs in previous academic environments, and our interest in exploring the potential of serious games to contribute more to society.

## Tech

This repository holds code for a front-end system, which is written in [Angular 6](https://angular.io/).
All relevant code for the game can be found in the ./angular folder.

## Build

On a Linux or Windows command line (assuming all software and dependencies are installed), run `ng build --prod --base-href "/ph471/FYP/" --deploy-url "/ph471/FYP/"`.
Note that this command will not work correctly when run on Git Bash for Windows.
