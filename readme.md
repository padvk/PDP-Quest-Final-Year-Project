## Personal Development Planner Game

Personal development plans (PDPs) are a great tool for developing ones own skills and reflecting upon their progression towards some personal goal if that person is motivated enough to correctly engage with their plan. However, people often find PDPs boring, and naturally they wont refer to their plan as often as they should, or sometimes might forget about it entirely. PDPs have great potential to assist in personal development but are impractical and area waste of time if the user is uninterested.

## Project aim

This project will examine whether presenting a PDP as a game is more likely to engage a player in their plan, and if so, how much more effective would it be in developing the playerâ€™s skills.

## Tech
